# -Management-of-Red-Clover-forage-harvest-in-grassland-using-Deep-learning-and-Robotics
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on the management of Red Clover forage harvest in grassland using deep learning and robotics. The project aims to optimize forage harvest by implementing cutting-edge technology.
Modifying and Training a deep learning model to accurately classify red clover growth, including vegetative state, budding, and fully bloomed flowers, using Image Classification and Object Detection 
Developing a recommendation system to determine the optimal harvest time, to maximize crop digestibility.
predicting the image dataset whether the given image to the model is with or without flowers
EfficientNet classification model was used to classify the given images
Dataset analysis and management for improved agricultural efficiency.
